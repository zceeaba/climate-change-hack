| SD04 | How can we support communities and organisations in ‘data poor’ environments such as in the Sahel and parts of Southern Africa to know when and where to get ready for a disaster? Many places where disasters occur often lack vulnerability and exposure data about communities at risk. Hydro-meteorological data can also be sometimes lacking. These data points are critical to creating triggers protocols which hydro-meteorological services and communities agree on and early action protocols that are carried out once a forecast reaches a certain threshold. This data can help prompt early humanitarian action, which can help save lives and reduce the impact of the disaster. What approach can be taken to collect data to feed into impact-based forecasts from data poor locations (with a focus on vulnerability and exposure data) in the Sahel and southern parts of Africa? -> Could we crowdsource data? How can volunteers act as agents to feed into impact-based forecasts? What data could local volunteers collect within a country to feed into impact-based forecasts? What would they collect? How would they collect and report it? How would it be visualised for decision makers to respond? What other datasets are useful for identifying exposure and vulnerability? E.g., How can OpenStreetMap data be used? This is useful for flood risk (mapping roads, houses and buildings) but might have less clear use for drought risk. What attributes might be useful to know (public or internal) for different disasters? What open data sets are available that can be used to support this. | Sustainable Development: How can we support communities and organisations to know when to better prepare for emergencies by the prediction of a climate hazard? | Sustainable Development 2: Support the most vulnerable communities | Paul Knight and Caroline Zastiral (British Red Cross) |

##### Overall Solution – Playback
 - Focus on the one specific area.
**Choice** - Sahel or Southern Africa – took these options from the Deck which is highlighted on the git repo here, the very bottom one - https://github.com/COP26-Hackathon/Met-Office-Climate-Data-Challenge-March_2021/wiki/Challenges   
 - Present this back as a useful tool to better prepare for climate related emergencies.
**Choice** – how’s easiest to share back all of the information?
